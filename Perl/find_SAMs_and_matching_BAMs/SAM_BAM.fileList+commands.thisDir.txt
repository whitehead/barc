SAM+BAM: ./B.SAM <==> ./B.BAM
SAM+BAM: ./C.sam <==> ./C.BAM ./C.bam ./C.sorted.BAM
SAM only: ./D.sam

# If matching BAM file exists, delete SAM file.
rm -f ./A.sam
rm -f ./B.SAM
rm -f ./C.sam

# If matching BAM file doesn't exist, create it.
# Note that these commands will fail if the SAM file doesn't have a header.
